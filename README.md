- Multiple components which show the correct usage of MVC pattern
- The use of a client networking model that interfaces with the REST API
- At least three unit tests

## API

> This starter kit provides the basic API you will need to complete your coding challenge. See [Using the REST API](#using-the-rest-api) for more information.

### Quick start

#### 1. Run `npm install`

This will install all dependencies (listed in `package.json`) necessary to get the API up and running.

#### 2. Run `npm run api`

`npm run api` will start [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to provide a stubbed out REST API through `localhost:9000`.

---

**NOTE**

On occasion you may find the port 9000 is already in use. You can change this in the package.json.

---

## Using the REST API

> Note: Ensure that you've started the API server with `npm run api`.

A REST API is provided with seed data for blog posts and comments. The REST API returns and accepts JSON. Changes made to the "database" will persist as long as the API is running on `localhost:9000`.

**Base path:** http://localhost:9000

**GET** `/posts` _List all blog posts_<br>
**GET** `/posts/{id}` _View single blog post_<br>
**GET** `/posts/{id}/comments` _List all comments for single blog post_<br>
**POST** `/posts/{id}/comments` _Add comment to single blog post_<br>
**PUT** `/comments/{id}` _Update single comment_<br>

## Delivering to LetsGetChecked

You may zip up your entire application directly and deliver the source code to LetsGetChecked. Ensure that extraneous folders, eg. `/node_modules`, are not included in the zip file. If you've initialized Git in the application directory locally, you may use [git clean](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean) to remove uncommitted and ignored files before compressing the project.

Alternatively you can provide a link to a git/bitbucket/etc repository which contains the application code.

If you wish to go a step further you may host the final product for demo purposes, eg. with AWS S3. However, this is not required for completion of the code challenge.

**Thank you, and enjoy the challenge!**
